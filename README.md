Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software.
It is important in today's tech industry because software engineers design and develop games, websites, apps, network control systems and much more

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phases in the software Development Life Cycle are:
  -Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
for example, if i am building with LEGOs! Waterfall is like following a set of instructions step-by-step, perfect for when you know exactly what you want. Agile is like building freely, trying things out and changing as you go, great for when you're exploring new ideas.Waterfall is best for projects where you know exactly what you want, while Agile is better when you're still figuring things out and might want to make changes along the way.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is like your amazing toolbox, giving you all the right tools to build your project smoothly. A VCS is like a "save game" feature, letting you go back to earlier versions if you make a mistake. IDEs help you write code faster and find errors easily, like having a helpful guide. VCS lets you work with friends on the same project without things getting messy. Both tools are super important for making awesome software, just like a builder needs good tools and a plan. Examples of IDEs are Visual Studio and examples of VCs are Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common problems faced in software engineering are:
-changing requirements
-tight deadlines
strategies to overcome these are effective communication and prioritisation of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
mportance of Testing
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It helps in making your questions clear and specific to AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt-"tell me about space."
improved prompt-"explain the climate conditions on planet venus"
